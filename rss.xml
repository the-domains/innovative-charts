            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How A Man's Fitbit Got Him The Medical Care He Needed</h1><p>On Jan. 5, a man checked into a hospital's emergency room in Camden, New Jersey.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>3sixteen + Herman Miller</h1><p>LES-based raw denim fiends 3sixteen advocate skilled craftsmanship and longevity-which is why they often post photos of their customers' faded, worn-in jeans after years of use. Thus, their special collaboration with design manufacturer Herman Miller makes perfect sense, as there's a shared commitment to inspiring through timeless, dependable design.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f04a92fd70ba0596ea6b8079424cfee8970ec89c.jpg"></article>]]></description>
